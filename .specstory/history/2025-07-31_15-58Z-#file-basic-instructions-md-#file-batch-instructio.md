follow the instructions, convert /_posts/2007/*.html, convert the chinese filename, convert the html content to markdown

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you convert the HTML files in the `` directory following the provided instructions. Let me first read the instruction files to understand the requirements, then examine the current state of the files. Now let me examine the current state of the `_tasks.md` file and check what's in the 2007 directory: Now I need to create a task list in `_tasks.md` following the batch instructions. Let me identify all the HTML files that need to be converted: Let me get the complete list of HTML files in 2007: Let me use the proper WSL path format: The output is getting truncated due to the special characters. Let me use a different approach to get the list: Now let me create the task list in `_tasks.md` by first getting the filenames programmatically: Perfect! Now I'll create the task list in `_tasks.md` following the batch instructions format: Now I'll also create the `_tasks.log` file to track the process: Let me check if the log file exists: I'll append to the existing log file: Let me read the end of the log file to see the current format: I'll append to the log file: 
```

```
Now I have created the task list according to the batch instructions. I have:

1. ✅ Created a new section in `_tasks.md` with the current timestamp
2. ✅ Recorded the original requirement and instructions being followed
3. ✅ Created a checklist of all 48 HTML files that need to be processed
4. ✅ Updated the `_tasks.log` file to track the process

The task list shows 48 HTML files in the `` directory that need to be:
1. **Converted from Chinese filenames to English** following the naming conventions in `basic.instructions.md`
2. **Converted from HTML content to Markdown format**
3. **Updated with proper YAML frontmatter** and redirect_from entries

According to the batch instructions, I should confirm with you before starting to process the first file. 

**Please confirm if you want me to proceed with processing these 48 files following the established workflow?**

Each file will be processed to:
- Convert Chinese characters in filename to descriptive English
- Convert HTML content to Markdown
- Add proper YAML frontmatter with redirect_from entries
- Update the URL mapping file for Disqus migration
- Update the checklist status as I progress

_**User**_

ok, continue going process.

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! I'll now start processing the first file from the list. Let me begin with `2007-02-03-新手機真是讚-y-ii.html`. 
```

```

```

```
Now let me read the first HTML file to understand its content: Let me read more of the file to get the complete content: Now I understand the content. This is a blog post about a new phone (Dopod C720W) with Chinese title "新手機真是讚 (y) - II" which means something like "New Phone is Awesome (y) - II". Based on the naming conventions, I need to convert this to an English filename. Let me create the new markdown file with proper English filename and convert HTML to markdown: Now let me update the URL mapping file as required by the instructions: 
```

```
Now let me remove the original HTML file and update the task status: 
```

```

```

```
Perfect! I've successfully processed the first file. Now let me continue with the second file: `2007-02-07-windows-live-writer-plugin-處女作.html` 
```

```

```

```
Let me continue reading the rest of the file: The file ends at line 100. Now I'll create the markdown version with proper English filename. The title "處女作" means "first work" or "debut work", so this is about a Windows Live Writer plugin that was his first attempt: 
```

```

```

```

```

```
Great! I've successfully processed the second file. Now let me continue with the third file: `2007-02-12-generic-type-的繼承.html` 
```

```

```

```
This appears to be the complete file. The title "Generic Type 的繼承" means "Generic Type Inheritance", which is about .NET generics and inheritance patterns. Let me create the markdown version: 
```

```
Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

I'm making good progress! I've successfully converted 3 files so far. To optimize the process, let me continue with a few more files efficiently. Let me process the next file: `2007-02-14-好樣的多普達.html` 
```

```
This is a short post. Let me create the markdown version. "好樣的多普達" means something like "Well done Dopod" or "Good job Dopod" (Dopod being a smartphone brand): 
```

```

```

```

```

```
Excellent! I've processed 4 files successfully. The workflow is running smoothly. Let me continue with batch processing. Since there are still 44 files remaining and the process is quite repetitive, I'll continue efficiently. 

I've established a good pattern for the conversion:
1. ✅ Convert Chinese filenames to English following naming conventions
2. ✅ Convert HTML content to Markdown format  
3. ✅ Preserve YAML frontmatter with redirect_from entries
4. ✅ Update URL mapping for Disqus migration
5. ✅ Track progress in tasks.md and tasks.log

**Current Status:** 
- **Completed:** 4/48 files (8.3%)
- **Remaining:** 44 files

The process is working well and following the instructions correctly. Each file is being:
- Converted from Chinese to descriptive English filenames
- HTML content properly converted to Markdown syntax
- Original permalink preserved in redirect_from
- URL mapping updated for Disqus migration

Would you like me to continue processing the remaining 44 files, or would you prefer to pause here and review the work completed so far?

I'll continue with the next file: `2007-02-16-web-site-application-sandcastle.html`. This one already has an English filename, so it should be straightforward. 
```

```

```

```
This file already has an English filename and is about technical topics (Sandcastle documentation tool), so I'll keep the same filename. Let me convert it to markdown: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me continue with the next file that has Chinese characters: `2007-02-18-community-server-2007-beta-1-available-now.html`. This one already has English filename so I'll keep it as is. 
```

```
This is a short file about Community Server 2007 Beta 1. Let me create the markdown version: 
```

```

```

```
Let me update the log file and continue with the next file: 
```

```
Great progress! I've successfully processed 6 files. Let me continue with the next file that has Chinese characters: `2007-02-19-ie7-終於升級成功了.html` 
```

```
This is a short post about successfully upgrading to IE7. The title "IE7 終於升級成功了" means "IE7 finally upgraded successfully". Let me create the markdown version: 
```

```

```

```
Excellent! I've now processed 7 files successfully. The workflow is running smoothly and efficiently. 

**Current Status:**
- **Completed:** 7/48 files (14.6%)
- **Successfully converted files with Chinese filenames:**
  - `新手機真是讚-y-ii.html` → `new-phone-awesome-part-ii.md`

I'll continue with the next file. Let me update the log first and then process `2007-02-22-network-bridge-in-windows-2003.html`. 
```

```
Now let me continue with the next file: 
```

```
This file already has an English title about network bridging in Windows 2003. Let me create the markdown version:

Excellent progress! I've now processed 9 files successfully. Let me update the log and continue with a few more files to maintain good momentum: 
```

```
**Current Status Update:**

This was a fascinating technical deep-dive article about multiple approaches (Plans A, B, C, and D) to solve the Fiddler-TFS conflict issue. The author went through:

1. **Plan A**: Direct access to Fiddler's internal proxy settings (blocked by private fields)
2. **Plan B**: Console application using Fiddler.dll (worked standalone but failed in script)
3. **Plan C**: Using Reflection to bypass AppDomain restrictions (still failed)
4. **Plan D**: The "inelegant" solution - calling an external .exe from the Fiddler script (finally worked!)

We're now at **24 out of 48 files completed (50% progress)** - we've hit the halfway mark! 🎉

The conversion continues smoothly with:
- ✅ Complex technical content with multiple code blocks properly converted
