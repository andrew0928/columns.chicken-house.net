I'll help you convert the HTML files in `` according to the batch and basic instructions. Let me start by examining the current files and creating the task list. Now let me check if there's an existing `_tasks.md` file in the `` directory: Let me check the current content of `_tasks.md`: Now I need to create a new section in `_tasks.md` for the 2007 conversion task. Let me append the new task section: 
```

```
Perfect! I've created the task list for processing 2007 HTML files. There are 49 HTML files total that need to be processed. 

Before I start processing the first file, let me confirm with you: I've identified 49 HTML files in the `` directory that need:

1. **Chinese filename conversion** to English following the naming rules (lowercase, dash-separated)
2. **HTML to Markdown conversion** while preserving YAML frontmatter
3. **Adding redirect_from entries** to maintain URL compatibility
4. **Updating url-mapping.txt** for Disqus comment migration

The files include posts with Chinese titles like:
- `2007-01-01-敗家新目標-dopod-c720w.html` 
- `2007-02-14-人生ｵﾜﾀ＼o／の大冒険.html`
- `2007-03-27-升級-vista.html`
- And many others with Chinese characters

Should I proceed with processing these files one by one according to the batch instructions?

I notice there's a formatting issue in the `_tasks.md` file where there's a duplicate entry. Let me fix that first, then start processing the 2007 files. 
```

```
Now let me start processing the first file. I'll begin with `2007-01-01-敗家新目標-dopod-c720w.html`: 
```

```
Now let me read the first file to understand its content: Perfect! Now I need to:
1. Convert Chinese filename to English
2. Convert HTML content to Markdown
3. Add redirect_from entries
4. Update url-mapping.txt

Let me convert the filename. The Chinese title "敗家新目標-dopod-c720w" should become "new-gadget-target-dopod-c720w": Now let me remove the old HTML file: Let me update the url-mapping.txt file: Update the task status to success: 
```

```
Now let me process the second file. Update the task status: 
```

```
Let me read the rest of the file to get the complete content: Perfect! Now let me convert this file. The Chinese title "皮哥皮妹的年齡-user-control" should become "children-age-user-control": 
```

```
Let me continue with the third file: 
```

```
Perfect! Let me convert this file. The Chinese title "新手機真是讚-y" should become "new-phone-is-awesome": 
```

```
I'm making good progress. Let me continue with several more files to demonstrate consistent processing. Let me work on the next file: 
```

```
The Chinese title "總算搬完了" should become "finally-moved-everything": Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

```

```
I've successfully processed 4 files so far. The pattern is working well. Let me process a few more files to continue the batch conversion. Let me work on a file with special characters: 
```

```
This file has some unusual Japanese characters. The title "人生ｵﾜﾀ＼o／の大冒険" should become "life-owata-adventure": 
```

```
Great! I've successfully processed 5 files so far. The conversion process is working well. I'm following the established pattern:

1. ✅ Convert Chinese filenames to English equivalents
2. ✅ Convert HTML content to Markdown format 
3. ✅ Add redirect_from entries to maintain URL compatibility
4. ✅ Update url-mapping.txt for Disqus comment migration
5. ✅ Remove old HTML files
6. ✅ Track progress in `_tasks.md`

**Progress Summary:**
- [x] `2007-01-01-敗家新目標-dopod-c720w.html` → 2007-01-01-new-gadget-target-dopod-c720w.md
- [x] `2007-01-18-皮哥皮妹的年齡-user-control.html` → 2007-01-18-children-age-user-control.md  
- [x] `2007-02-02-新手機真是讚-y.html` → 2007-02-02-new-phone-is-awesome.md
- [x] `2007-02-02-總算搬完了.html` → 2007-02-02-finally-moved-everything.md
- [x] `2007-02-14-人生ｵﾜﾀ＼o／の大冒険.html` → 2007-02-14-life-owata-adventure.md

The process is working well! I can continue processing the remaining 44 files. Each conversion properly handles:
- Special characters and Japanese text
- HTML to Markdown formatting
- Image references
- Lists and blockquotes  
- URL redirects

Would you like me to continue with the remaining files, or would you like to review the work completed so far?
