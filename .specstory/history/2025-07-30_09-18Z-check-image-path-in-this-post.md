check image path in this post

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll check the image paths in the post file `2016-02-07-buy_minipc_server.md` according to the rules specified in the normalize-image-file-location instructions. Now I'll analyze all the image paths in this post according to the normalize-image-file-location instructions:

Based on the post content, I found the following variables:
- `post_id` = `2016-02-07-buy_minipc_server`
- `year` = `2016`

Let me identify all the images in the post and check their paths: Now let me check if these image files exist in their current locations and verify if they should be moved according to the rules: Let me check for the specific images referenced in the post: Great! All the images exist. Now let me check if the target directory exists according to the rules (should be `/wp-content/images/{post_id}/*`): The target directory doesn't exist. According to the normalize-image-file-location instructions, I need to:

1. Create the proper directory structure: `/wp-content/images/2016-02-07-buy_minipc_server/`
2. Move all the images from `` to the new location  
3. Update the markdown file to reflect the new paths

Let me create the directory and move the images: Now let me verify the images were copied successfully: Let me try with a single command to copy all files at once: Perfect! All images have been copied to the correct directory. Now I need to update the markdown file to use the new image paths. According to the rules, all local images should use the path `/wp-content/images/{post_id}/*`:

Perfect! I have successfully checked and normalized all the image paths in the post `2016-02-07-buy_minipc_server.md`. Here's a summary of what I found and did:

## Image Path Analysis Results

**Post Details:**
- `post_id`: `2016-02-07-buy_minipc_server`  
- `year`: `2016`

**Images Found:** 10 images total

**Issues Identified:**

**Actions Taken:**

2. ✅ Copied all 10 images from the old location to the new correct location:

   - `img_56b7ec0d66a42.png`
3. ✅ Updated all image paths in the markdown file from `` to ``

**External Images:** 
- 1 external link found pointing to `http://tw.taobao.com/` - this is correctly treated as an external image and was not modified

All image paths in this post are now compliant with the normalize-image-file-location rules. The images are properly organized in the post-specific directory and the markdown file has been updated to reference the correct paths.
