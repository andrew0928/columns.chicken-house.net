I'll continue processing the remaining 2008 posts according to the instructions. Let me start with the next unprocessed item: `2008-09-12-visual-studio-2008-sp1-released.html`. Let me check what files exist in the 2008 directory: I can see that the file `2008-09-12-visual-studio-2008-sp1-released.html` is not in the directory. It appears that all the HTML files that are listed as unprocessed in the task list either don't exist or have already been converted. Let me check the next file in the list: `2008-09-22-c-yield-return-2-另類的應用-thread-sync-替代方案.html`. Now let me read the rest of the file to see the complete content: Now I'll process this file. First, let me mark it as processing in the tasks file: 
```

```
Now I'll convert the HTML content to Markdown format. The title should remain in Chinese as per the user's instruction: Now I'll delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Now I'll append the URL mapping to the url-mapping.txt file: Now I'll update the task status to success and continue with the next file: 
```

```
Now let me process the next file: `2008-09-27-令人火大的-sql-字元編碼.html`: Let me read the rest of the file: Now I'll mark this file as processing and convert it: 
```

```
Now I'll convert the HTML content to Markdown: Now I'll delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Now I'll update the task status to success and continue with the next file: 
```

```
Now let me process the next file: `2008-09-28-google-讓人越來越笨.html`: Let me read the rest of the file: Now I'll mark this file as processing and convert it: Let me check the current state of the tasks file: I notice the task status for the 2008-09-22 file is not marked with [x] but should be. Let me correct that first and then update the 2008-09-27 and 2008-09-28 files: 
```

```
Now I'll convert the Google HTML content to Markdown: Now I'll delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Now I'll update the task status to success and continue with the next file: 
```

```
Let me continue with the next unprocessed files. Let me check which files are actually remaining by processing a few more. Let me process `2008-09-28-msdn-magazine-十月號竟然下架了.html`: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

Let me read the rest of the file: Now I'll mark this file as processing and convert it: 
```

```
Now I'll convert the HTML content to Markdown: Now I'll delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Now I'll update the task status to success: 
```

```
Let me continue with the remaining files. I'll process several more to complete the task efficiently. Let me continue with `2008-10-02-得獎了-d.html`: I'll process this file as well. Let me mark it as processing and convert it: 
```

```
Now I'll convert the HTML content to Markdown: Now I'll delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Now I'll update the task status to success: 
```

```
I'll continue processing the remaining files efficiently. Let me process several more files. Let me check if there are many files remaining by looking at the task list: There are 9 more files to process. Let me continue with the next few files efficiently. Let me process `2008-10-10-終於升速了.html`: This is a short file. Let me process it: 
```

```

```

```
Let me continue with the remaining files. I've processed most of the 2008 posts now. Let me continue more efficiently by processing multiple files in parallel where possible. Let me check the next few files and process them: This is a long file. Let me get the rest of it first and then process it: Now let me process this file: 
```

```
This file already has an English title, so I don't need to translate it. I'll convert it to Markdown: 
```

```
I'll continue with the remaining files more efficiently. Let me process several more. The pattern shows that many of these are short content, so I can process them faster: Let me process several files in batch to be more efficient. Let me work on this file and then continue with the remaining ones: 
```

```

```

```
Let me continue with the remaining 5 files. I'll process them more efficiently by working on multiple at once. Let me get the next file: This is a short file. Let me process it: 
```

```

```

```
Let me continue with the remaining 4 files. I'll process them quickly: Let me get the rest of this file: This is also a short file. Let me process it:
