_**Assistant**_

I'll help you convert the HTML files in the `` directory according to the provided instructions. Let me start by following the batch processing rules and creating the task list. Now let me create the task list according to the batch processing rules: Let me check the existing tasks file: I can see that there's already a task list in progress from January 31, 2025. I need to append a new section for the current task. Let me add the new task section: 
```

```
Perfect! I've created the task list according to the batch processing rules. Now let me confirm with you before starting the actual processing:

**Task Summary:**
- Processing remaining 2006 HTML files that have Chinese characters in filenames
- Converting Chinese filenames to English following naming conventions 
- Converting HTML content to Markdown format
- Following both batch.instructions.md and basic.instructions.md rules

**Files to process (14 files with Chinese filenames):**
1. `2006-10-29-替-app_code-目錄下的-code-寫單元測試.html`
2. `2006-10-31-新硬碟-hitachi-travelstar-5k160.html`
3. `2006-11-03-canon-digital-camera-相機獨享-記憶卡歸檔工具.html`

5. `2006-11-04-小紅點缺料-lenovo-sucks.html`
6. `2006-11-11-css-擋右鍵.html`
7. `2006-11-11-沒網路.html`
8. `2006-11-12-ie6-縮放網頁-using-css-htc.html`
9. `2006-11-17-canon-digital-camera-記憶卡歸檔工具-release-notes.html`
10. `2006-11-19-ya-community-chicken-house-net-滿兩週年了-d.html`
11. `2006-12-10-又來了.html`
12. `2006-12-10-升級失敗-orz.html`
13. `2006-12-10-終於升級上來了.html`
14. `2006-12-23-歸檔工具更新-cr2-supported.html`

**Process for each file:**
1. Read the original HTML file
2. Convert Chinese filename to English following naming rules
3. Convert HTML content to Markdown format
4. Add redirect_from entries for old URLs
5. Create new .md file with converted content
6. Remove original .html file
7. Update url-mapping.txt with old/new URL mapping
8. Update task progress in `_tasks.md` and _tasks.log

Is this correct? Should I proceed with processing the first file?

_**User**_

0. you should update  _tasks.md , _tasks.log first

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! According to the batch processing instructions, I need to update the task status and log before starting. Let me update the `_tasks.md` to mark the first file as "processing" and create/update the _tasks.log. 
```

```
Now let me check if _tasks.log exists and update it: Let me append the current processing log to the _tasks.log: Let me read more of the log file to see the exact format: Now I can append to the log file properly: 
```

```
Perfect! Now I've updated both `_tasks.md` and `_tasks.log` as required by the batch processing instructions. The status shows:

1. ✅ Updated `_tasks.md` - marked first file as "processing"
2. ✅ Updated `_tasks.log` - added new section and logged the start of processing

Now I'm ready to proceed with processing the first file: `2006-10-29-替-app_code-目錄下的-code-寫單元測試.html`

Should I proceed with the actual file conversion now?

_**User**_

OK

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! Now I'll start processing the first file. Let me read the original HTML file and convert it according to the instructions. Now I need to convert this HTML to Markdown format. Based on the filename, the new English filename should be something like "writing-unit-tests-for-app-code-directory". Let me create the new Markdown file: Now I need to remove the original HTML file: Let me use the correct path format for WSL: Now I need to update the url-mapping.txt file: Let me append the new mapping to the file: 
```

```
Now I need to update the task status. First, let me update `_tasks.md` to mark this file as success: 
```

```
Now let me update _tasks.log: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully completed the conversion of the first file. Let me now start processing the second file by updating the task status: 
```

```
Now let me update the log and read the second file: 
```

```
Now I'll convert this HTML file to Markdown format with an English filename: Remove the original HTML file: Update the url-mapping.txt: 
```

```
Update task status to success: 
```

```
Update the log: 
```

```
Excellent! I've successfully converted 2 files so far. Let me continue with the third file. Let me update the status and continue:
