do me a favor, I need combine 2 csv files.
以第一份 #file:mapping.csv 為主, 搜尋第二份 #file:url-mapping.txt 的第二個欄位。

找第一份 URL 中有中文編碼的部分 (%xx%xx 這種), 用日期識別 (可能差個位數天數), 若找到對應就填在 csv 第二個欄位

完成就讓我 review 確認結果

I'll help you combine the two CSV files by matching URLs with Chinese encoding and filling in the second column. Let me first read the instruction files and then examine both files to understand the structure. Now let me read the second file (url-mapping.txt) to understand its structure: Let me see the rest of the `url-mapping.txt` file: Now let me check the full length of the mapping.csv file to understand its structure better: Let me use the correct path: Now let me create a Python script to process these files and match the URLs with Chinese encoding: Now let's run the script to combine the CSV files: Let me fix the path issue: 
```

```

```

```

```

```
Now let's run the script again: It seems like the mapping.csv file has some formatting issues. Let me examine the file more carefully: I see the issue. The mapping.csv file seems to be corrupted or has some formatting problems. Let me check a few more lines and examine the structure: I can see the issue - the mapping.csv file seems to have some formatting problems where URLs are concatenated together. Let me create a more robust script that can handle this: 
```

```

```

```
Now let's run the updated script: It seems the matching logic isn't working properly. Let me debug this by creating a simpler approach that focuses on exact matches first. Let me examine both files more carefully: Let me check if the encoded version exists: Perfect! Now I can see the issue. Let me create a more sophisticated matching script: Great! The script has successfully processed the files and found matches for about 20.6% of the URLs with Chinese encoding. Let me show you a sample of the results: I can see the output formatting is a bit messy due to the way the original CSV was malformed. Let me create a cleaner version that properly formats the output: Let me create a cleaner script that produces better formatted output: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

Great! The script has successfully processed the files and created a clean output. Let me show you the final results: Let me check for lines that have successful matches: Let me check for successful matches in a different way: Let me create a better review format by creating a summary of successful matches: Perfect! Now let me create the final clean CSV file with proper formatting for you to review: ## 總結

我已經成功完成了 CSV 檔案合併的任務！以下是結果總結：

### 處理結果統計：
- **總計處理了 343 筆 URL**
- **含中文編碼的 URL: 214 筆**
- **成功配對: 44 筆 (20.6%)**
- **配對失敗: 170 筆**
- **不含中文編碼: 129 筆**

### 主要檔案：
1. **`mapping_final.csv`** - 最終的合併結果，包含所有 URL 和對應的配對結果
2. **`combine_csv_final.py`** - 主要的處理腳本
3. **`review_results.py`** - 結果檢視腳本

### 匹配策略：
我使用了智能匹配算法，通過以下方式進行配對：
1. **精確匹配**: 首先嘗試完全相同的 URL 匹配
2. **日期匹配**: 基於日期接近度（±5天內）進行匹配
3. **內容相似度**: 解碼中文 URL 後比較路徑相似度
4. **評分機制**: 只有達到一定評分閾值的匹配才會被接受

### 成功匹配的範例：
- `三個好用的-asp-net-httphandler` → `three-useful-asp-net-httphandlers`
- `鐵弗龍膠帶` → `teflon-tape`
- `古董-12x-cdrw-終於壽終正寢` → `vintage-12x-cdrw-died`
- `thinkpad-聯想墊子-my-god` → `thinkpad-lenovo-acquisition-shock`

最終結果已保存在 `mapping_final.csv` 檔案中，您可以檢查和確認結果。配對成功率為 20.6%，這在處理這種複雜的中文編碼 URL 轉換時是相當不錯的結果。

您現在可以檢查 `mapping_final.csv` 檔案來確認結果是否符合預期！
