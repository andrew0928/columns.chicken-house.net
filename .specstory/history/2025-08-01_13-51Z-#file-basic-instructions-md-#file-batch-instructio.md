I'll continue processing the 2008 posts according to the batch instructions. Looking at the tasks file, I can see that `2008-08-15-thread-sync-2-實作篇-互相等待的兩個執行緒.html` is marked as "processing", so I need to change it to "failed" first and then reprocess it, then continue with the remaining unprocessed files.

Let me start by updating the task status and then process the files one by one. 
```

```
Now let me process the first file: `2008-08-15-thread-sync-2-實作篇-互相等待的兩個執行緒.html`. First, I'll read the file to understand its content and determine the appropriate English title. Let me read more of the content to understand the full context: Based on the content, this appears to be the second part of a thread synchronization series about "implementation - two threads waiting for each other". The appropriate English title would be: `2008-08-15-thread-sync-2-implementation-two-threads-waiting-for-each-other.md`

Let me update the task status to processing first: 
```

```
Now I'll read the complete file to convert it properly: Now I'll create the new markdown file with the converted content. I need to:
1. Add the redirect entry for the old filename
2. Remove the permalink line
3. Convert HTML content to markdown
4. Keep the title as is (according to instructions)

2. Convert HTML to Markdown format
3. Create the new file
4. Update task tracking Now I need to add the URL mapping entry and delete the old HTML file: Now I'll update the task status to success: 
```

```
Now let me process the next file: `2008-08-23-tips-踢掉遠端桌面連線的使用者.html`. Let me read this file to understand its content: This is about remote desktop tips, specifically disconnecting remote desktop users. The appropriate English title would be: `2008-08-23-tips-disconnecting-remote-desktop-users.md`

Let me read the full file and convert it: Now I'll create the markdown version: Now I'll add the URL mapping and delete the original file: Now I'll update the task status and move to the next file: 
```

```
Now let me process the next file: `2008-08-23-世紀末軟體革命復刻版.html`. Let me read this file: This is about a reprint of a classic software development book called "世紀末軟體革命" (End of Century Software Revolution Reprint). The appropriate English title would be: `2008-08-23-end-of-century-software-revolution-reprint.md`

Let me create the markdown version: Now I'll add the URL mapping and delete the original file: Now I'll update the task status and move to the next file:

Let me update the progress and continue with the next files:

```
I'll continue with the next several files to make good progress. Let me process the next file: `2008-08-28-canon-g9-害我沒睡好-相片自動轉正的問題.html` This is about Canon G9 camera and automatic photo rotation issues. The appropriate English title would be: `2008-08-28-canon-g9-kept-me-awake-photo-auto-rotation-problem.md`

Let me read more of the content and convert it: Now I'll create the markdown version: Now I'll add the URL mapping, delete the original file, and continue with the next files: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.
