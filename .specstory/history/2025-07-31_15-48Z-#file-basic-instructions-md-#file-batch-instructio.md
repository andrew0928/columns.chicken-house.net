follow the instructions, convert /_posts/2006/*.html, convert the chinese filename, convert the html content to markdown

_**Assistant**_

I'll first read the instruction files to understand the requirements for converting the HTML files to Markdown, then examine the 2006 posts that need to be converted. Now let me examine the 2006 posts to see what HTML files need to be converted: Let me get a proper list of all unique files in the 2006 directory: Now I can see there are 3 HTML files that need to be converted. Let me read the current tasks file to understand its state: Now I'll create the task list following the batch instructions. First, let me identify all the HTML files in 2006: I see the log file already has some content. Let me clear it and start fresh: 
```

```
Perfect! I've created the task list with 3 HTML files that need to be converted. Before I start processing, let me confirm the task list is ready. The files to process are:

1. `2006-12-25-background-thread-in-asp-net.html`
2. `2006-12-06-volume-shadow-copy-service.html`  
3. `2006-12-10-cs-2-1-sp2-metaweblog-api-newmediaobject-method-support.html`

Based on the batch instructions, I need to confirm with you before starting. The task list has been created in `_tasks.md` and I'm ready to begin processing these 3 HTML files. Each will be:

1. Converted from HTML to Markdown format
2. Have proper YAML frontmatter added
3. Include redirect_from entries for the old URLs
4. Be saved as .md files
5. Have the original .html files deleted
6. Update the url-mapping.txt file for disqus migration

Should I proceed with processing the first file: `2006-12-25-background-thread-in-asp-net.html`?

keep going, do all the files in _tasks.md

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! I'll start processing all the files in the task list. Let me begin with the first file. 
```

```

```

```
Now let me read the first HTML file to understand its content: Now I'll convert this HTML file to Markdown format. The filename already appears to be in English, so no translation needed there: Let me try a different approach to delete the file: Now I'll update the URL mapping file: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me process the second file: Now I'll convert this second HTML file to Markdown: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me process the third and final file: Now I'll convert this third HTML file to Markdown: 
```

```

```

```
Perfect! I have successfully completed the conversion of all 3 HTML files from the 2006 directory to Markdown format. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:
