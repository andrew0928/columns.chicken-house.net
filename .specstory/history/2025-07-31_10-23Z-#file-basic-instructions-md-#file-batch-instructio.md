I'll check for existing batch tasks and continue processing them according to the instructions. Let me first check if there are any existing task files. I can see there's an existing batch task for processing 2005 HTML files. Let me check the log to see the current progress: Let me check the rest of the log to see where we left off: Perfect! I can see there's an existing batch task for processing 2005 HTML files, and according to the task list, 20 files have been completed successfully, while 12 files remain to be processed. According to the batch instructions, I need to continue from the first non-success file. Let me continue with the next unprocessed file.

The next file to process is `2005-06-08-hash-的妙用.html`. Let me start processing it: Now I'll update the task list to mark this file as processing and then proceed with the conversion: 
```

```

````

````
Now I'll create the new Markdown file with the proper English filename and convert the HTML content: Now I'll remove the old HTML file: Now I'll update the task list to mark this file as completed and log the completion: 
```

```

````

````
Now let me process the next file: `2005-06-08-機器又要討錢了.html` I'll update the task list to mark this file as processing: 
```

```

````

````
Now I'll create the new Markdown file with the proper English filename: Remove the old HTML file: Update the task list and log: 
```

```

````

````
Now let me continue with the next file: `2005-06-29-ibm-thinkpad-x111.html` Update the task list to mark this file as processing: 
```

```

````

````
Create the new Markdown file: Remove the old HTML file: Update the task list and log: 
```

```

````

````
Now let me continue with the next file: `2005-06-29-終於買了-gps.html` Update the task list to mark this file as processing: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

````

````
Create the new Markdown file: Remove the old HTML file: Update the task list and log: 
```

```

````

````
Let me continue processing the remaining files efficiently. Let me check how many files are left and process them in batches: Good! I can see that there are 8 files remaining to process. Let me continue with the next file: `2005-06-30-chickenhouse-web-communityserviceextension-新增功能.html` I'll process this file. First, update the task list: 
```

```

````

````
Create the new Markdown file: Remove the old HTML file: Update the task list and log: 
```

```

````

````
Let me continue with the remaining files efficiently. I'll process them one by one according to the batch instructions. Next file: `2005-07-03-chickenhouse-web-communityserverextension-新功能-之-2.html` Update the task list and process the file: 
```

```

````

````

```

```

````

````
Let me continue efficiently with the remaining 6 files. Next: `2005-07-04-愛鑽小路的-papago.html` Process this file: 
```

```

````

````

```

```

````

````
Let me continue with the remaining files. I'll process them systematically and efficiently. Let me do the last 5 files in a more streamlined way. Next: `2005-08-13-canon-powershot-s2-is.html` This file already has an English filename, so I just need to convert HTML to Markdown: 
```

```

````

````

```

```

````

````
Let me now process the last 4 remaining files efficiently. I'll continue with the systematic approach. Let me check and process the next files in sequence: Let me process this file: 
```

Now let me continue with the remaining 3 files. Let me process them quickly to finish the batch task:

````

````
Now let me handle the last 2 files to complete the batch task. Let me process the remaining files:

Now let me process the very last file: `2005-12-06-水電工.html` and the other December file. Let me check them: This file already has an English filename. Let me process it: 
```

```

Now let me process the final file: `2005-12-06-水電工.html` 
```

```

Perfect! I have successfully completed the batch task for processing all 2005 HTML files. Let me update the task summary:
