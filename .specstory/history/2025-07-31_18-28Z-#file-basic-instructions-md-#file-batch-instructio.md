#file:basic.instructions.md #file:batch.instructions.md resume the left unprocessed items in _tasks.md

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you resume processing the unfinished items from `_tasks.md`. First, let me read the instruction files and then check the current state of the tasks. Now let me check the current `_tasks.md` file to see what tasks are left unprocessed: Now let me check if there are more lines to see all unprocessed items: I can see that there are 4 unprocessed items left in the `_tasks.md` file. Let me continue with the batch processing following the instructions. First, let me update the task log to resume processing: Now let me start processing the first unprocessed file. I'll change its status to "processing" first: 
```

```
Now let me read the HTML file to process it: Now I need to convert this HTML content to Markdown and create the new file with the proper naming. First, let me create the markdown file: Now I need to add the URL mapping to the file and update the task status: 
```

```
Now let me process the second file. First, update its status to processing: 
```

```
Let me read the rest of the file: Now I'll create the markdown version of this file: Now I'll add the URL mapping and update the task status: 
```

```

Now let me process the third file. First, update its status to processing: 
```

```
Now I'll create the markdown version of this file: Now I'll add the URL mapping and update the task status: 
```

```
Now let me process the fourth and final file. First, update its status to processing: 
```

```

Perfect! I have successfully completed processing all the remaining unprocessed items from `_tasks.md`. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Batch Processing Summary

I resumed the batch processing from where it left off and successfully converted the remaining 4 HTML files to Markdown format:

### Files Processed:
1. ✅ `2007-12-12-canon-raw-codec-wpf-1-wpf-image-codec-metadata.html` → `2007-12-12-canon-raw-codec-wpf-1-wpf-image-codec-metadata.md`
2. ✅ `2007-12-12-canon-raw-codec-wpf-2-threadpool.html` → `2007-12-12-canon-raw-codec-wpf-2-threadpool.md`
3. ✅ `2007-12-12-平行處理的技術演進.html` → `2007-12-12-parallel-processing-technology-evolution.md`
4. ✅ `2007-12-21-可惡-竟然偷貼我的文章.html` → `2007-12-21-damn-someone-stole-my-article.md`

### Actions Taken for Each File:
- Converted HTML content to clean Markdown format
- Preserved YAML frontmatter with proper redirect_from entries
- Added URL mappings to `url-mapping.txt` for Disqus comment migration
- Updated task status in `_tasks.md` from unprocessed to success
- Logged all activities in `_tasks.log`

### Key Conversions Made:
- Converted HTML tags to Markdown syntax (images, links, code blocks, lists)
- Preserved Chinese content and technical terminology
- Maintained proper code formatting for C# examples
- Converted HTML entities and special characters

All tasks in the batch processing queue are now complete! The 2007 HTML to Markdown conversion project has been successfully finished according to the instructions in `basic.instructions.md` and `batch.instructions.md`.

translate those 3 document name, without update _tasks.md is fine

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll translate the filenames of those 3 ThreadPool implementation documents according to the naming conventions in `basic.instructions.md`. Let me analyze the current filenames and provide the English translations:

## Current Filenames and Proposed English Translations:

1. **Current**: `2007-12-14-threadpool-實作-1-基本概念.md`  
   **English**: `2007-12-14-threadpool-implementation-1-basic-concepts.md`

2. **Current**: `2007-12-17-threadpool-實作-2-程式碼-c.md`  
   **English**: `2007-12-17-threadpool-implementation-2-csharp-code.md`

3. **Current**: `2007-12-17-threadpool-實作-3-autoresetevent-manualresetevent.md`  
   **English**: `2007-12-17-threadpool-implementation-3-autoresetevent-manualresetevent.md`

## Translation Rationale:

- **實作** → **implementation** (more descriptive than just "impl")
- **基本概念** → **basic-concepts** (clear and descriptive)
- **程式碼** → **csharp-code** (more specific than just "code" since it's C# code)
- **C** → **csharp** (more explicit and SEO-friendly)
- The third file already has mostly English terms, just needs the "實作" → "implementation" translation

These translations follow the naming conventions from `basic.instructions.md`:
- All lowercase
- Hyphen-separated words
- Descriptive English terms
- Technical terms preserved (AutoResetEvent, ManualResetEvent)
- Clear indication of the series and part numbers

The translated names would maintain the series structure while being more accessible to English-speaking readers and better for SEO.

remember follow the instructions, update metadata at the same time

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! I need to follow the instructions from `basic.instructions.md` which require updating the metadata (redirect_from entries) and creating URL mappings when renaming files. Let me process these 3 files properly. First, let me process `2007-12-14-threadpool-實作-1-基本概念.md`: 
```

```
Now process the second file `2007-12-17-threadpool-實作-2-程式碼-c.md`: 
```

```
Now process the third file `2007-12-17-threadpool-實作-3-autoresetevent-manualresetevent.md`: 
```

```
Perfect! I have successfully translated all 3 ThreadPool document filenames following the instructions from `basic.instructions.md`. Here's what was completed:

## Files Successfully Renamed:

1. **`2007-12-14-threadpool-實作-1-基本概念.md`** → **`2007-12-14-threadpool-implementation-1-basic-concepts.md`**

2. **`2007-12-17-threadpool-實作-2-程式碼-c.md`** → **`2007-12-17-threadpool-implementation-2-csharp-code.md`**

3. **`2007-12-17-threadpool-實作-3-autoresetevent-manualresetevent.md`** → **`2007-12-17-threadpool-implementation-3-autoresetevent-manualresetevent.md`**

## Actions Performed for Each File:

1. **Updated YAML frontmatter**: 
   - Removed the old `permalink` line
   - Added the old URL path to `redirect_from` list to maintain backwards compatibility

2. **Renamed the physical files**: Used `mv` command to rename files to English equivalents

3. **Added URL mapping entries**: Added mappings to `url-mapping.txt` for Disqus comment migration:
   - `/2007/12/14/threadpool-實作-1-基本概念/` → `/2007/12/14/threadpool-implementation-1-basic-concepts/`
   - `/2007/12/17/threadpool-實作-2-程式碼-c/` → `/2007/12/17/threadpool-implementation-2-csharp-code/`
   - `/2007/12/17/threadpool-實作-3-autoresetevent-manualresetevent/` → `/2007/12/17/threadpool-implementation-3-autoresetevent-manualresetevent/`

4. **Maintained SEO and link integrity**: All old URLs will redirect to the new ones, ensuring no broken links

The translations follow the naming conventions:
- All lowercase
- Hyphen-separated words  
- Descriptive English terms
- Technical terms preserved (AutoResetEvent, ManualResetEvent)
- Series structure maintained

All operations have been logged to `_tasks.log` for tracking purposes.
