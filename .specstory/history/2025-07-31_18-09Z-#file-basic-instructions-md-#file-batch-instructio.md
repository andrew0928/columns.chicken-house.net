#file:basic.instructions.md #file:batch.instructions.md resume the left unprocessed items in _tasks.md

I need to check the current state of the batch processing tasks. Let me first examine the `_tasks.md` file to see what items are left unprocessed. Now let me see what processing is needed for the remaining files. I can see there are 8 files that haven't been processed yet (marked with `- [ ]`). According to the batch instructions, I need to update the task log and process these files one by one.

Let me first update the log to show I'm resuming the task: Now let me start processing the first unprocessed file: `2007-09-19-水電工日誌-3-查線-標線.html`. I'll update the checklist to show it's being processed: 
```

```
Now let me read the current HTML file to process it: Now I need to convert this HTML file to Markdown according to the naming conventions. First, let me translate the Chinese filename to English:

- 水電工日誌-3-查線-標線 = electrician-diary-3-wire-tracing-labeling

Let me create the markdown version: Now let me remove the original HTML file: Now let me add the URL mapping to the file: Now let me update the log and task status: 
```

```
Now let me proceed to the next file: `2007-09-26-水電工日誌-4-配接電話線-網路線.html`. Let me update the status first: 
```

```
Now I'll create the markdown version with the English filename translation:

- 水電工日誌-4-配接電話線-網路線 = electrician-diary-4-phone-network-wiring 
```

```
Now let me continue with the next file: `2007-10-03-水電工日誌-5-配接-cable-線.html` 
```

```
Translation for the filename:
- 水電工日誌-5-配接-cable-線 = electrician-diary-5-cable-wiring 
```

```
Continuing with the next file: `2007-10-05-水電工日誌-6-機櫃設備展示.html` 
```

```
Let me read the rest of the file: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.
