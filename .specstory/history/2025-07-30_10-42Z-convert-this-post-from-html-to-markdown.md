convert this post from html to markdown

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you convert the HTML post to Markdown format. First, let me read the current HTML file to see its content. Now I'll convert this HTML post to Markdown format. I'll create a new Markdown file with the same name but with a `.md` extension. Perfect! I've successfully converted the HTML post to Markdown format. Here's what I did in the conversion:

## Changes Made:

1. **File Extension**: Changed from `.html` to `.md`
2. **Front Matter**: Kept the Jekyll front matter exactly the same
3. **HTML to Markdown Conversions**:
   - `<img>` tags → `!alt text` format
   - `<strong>` tags → `**bold**` format
   - `<ul>` and `<li>` tags → standard Markdown bullet lists with `-`
   - `&nbsp;` HTML entities → removed (not needed in Markdown)
   - `<a href="">` tags → `[!description](link)` for linked images
   - Removed unnecessary HTML classes and styling attributes

4. **Image Handling**:
   - Converted the first image to a simple Markdown image
   - Added descriptive alt text for images
   - Kept the clickable image as a linked image using Markdown syntax

5. **Text Formatting**:
   - Preserved all the original Chinese text content
   - Maintained paragraph breaks and spacing
   - Converted HTML bold text to Markdown bold formatting

The new Markdown file maintains all the original content while using proper Markdown syntax that will render correctly in Jekyll. The front matter remains unchanged so the post will have the same URL structure and metadata.

You can now delete the original HTML file if you'd like, as the Markdown version contains all the same content in the proper format for Jekyll.

## Step 2-4: Already completed
The conversion from HTML to Markdown has been completed and the `.md` file is created.
