I'll help you process the remaining HTML files in the 2008 posts according to the instructions. First, let me read the instruction files to understand the requirements. Now let me check the current unprocessed items in the tasks file to see what needs to be processed: I can see there are 3 unprocessed HTML files (the file not found one will be skipped). Let me check if these files exist first: Great! All three files exist. Now I'll process them one by one according to the instructions. Let me start by updating the task status and then processing each file.

Let's start with the first file: 
```

```
Now let me read the first file to understand its content and create the appropriate English filename: Based on the content, this post is about discovering that .NET already has a built-in XmlNodeWriter. Let me create an appropriate English filename and convert the HTML to Markdown. The title should be about "dotnet-built-in-xmlnodewriter-discovery" or similar. Now I'll create the markdown version of this file with an appropriate English filename. Based on the content, the filename should be "dotnet-built-in-xmlnodewriter-discovery": Now I need to delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Now I'll add the URL mapping to the mapping file: Now update the task status to success: 
```

```
Now let's process the second file: 
```

```
Let me read the rest of the file to understand the content: Now I'll create the markdown version for this file. This post is about discovering a bug in System.Xml.XmlWellFormedWriter. The appropriate English filename would be "system-xml-xmlwellformedwriter-bug": Now I need to delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Update the task status to success: 
```

```
Now let's process the third and final file: 
```

```
This post is a follow-up about the XmlWellFormedWriter bug, so the appropriate English filename would be "xmlwellformedwriter-writeraw-bug-followup": Now I need to delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

Perfect! I have successfully processed all the remaining HTML files according to the instructions. Let me create a log entry to document the completion: ## Summary

I have successfully completed the processing of all remaining HTML files from the 2008 posts according to the instructions. Here's what was accomplished:

### Files Processed:
1. **`2008-12-07-原來-net-早就內建-xmlnodewriter-了.html`** → **2008-12-07-dotnet-built-in-xmlnodewriter-discovery.md**
2. **`2008-12-08-原來-system-xml-xmlwellformedwriter-有-bug.html`** → **2008-12-08-system-xml-xmlwellformedwriter-bug.md**  
3. **`2008-12-10-xmlwellformedwriter-writeraw-的-bug-後續發展.html`** → **2008-12-10-xmlwellformedwriter-writeraw-bug-followup.md**

### Actions Performed for Each File:
1. ✅ **Converted HTML content to Markdown** - Removed HTML tags, converted code blocks to markdown format, maintained all original content
2. ✅ **Created English filenames** - Translated Chinese titles to appropriate English equivalents
3. ✅ **Preserved titles** - Kept original Chinese titles in the frontmatter as requested
4. ✅ **Updated redirect_from** - Added original permalinks to redirect mappings
5. ✅ **Deleted original HTML files** - Removed the old HTML versions
6. ✅ **Updated URL mappings** - Added entries to `url-mapping.txt` for each converted file
7. ✅ **Updated task status** - Marked all items as completed in `_tasks.md`

### Key Principles Followed:
- **Content preservation**: All original content was maintained exactly as written, with no translation or modification of the actual article text
- **Format conversion only**: Only converted HTML markup to Markdown syntax
- **Proper file naming**: Used descriptive English filenames following the established conventions
- **URL continuity**: Ensured all old URLs will properly redirect to new locations

All tasks from the `_tasks.md` file have been completed successfully. The batch processing is now complete with all 2008 HTML files converted to Markdown format.
