resume the unprocessed tasks

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you resume the unprocessed tasks. First, let me read the instruction files to understand the coding rules, then check for any unprocessed tasks. Now let me check for any existing task files to understand what tasks need to be resumed: I can see there's an active task for converting 2007 HTML files to Markdown. The current file being processed is `2007-06-20-還是換回-xp-了.html` which is marked as "processing". Let me check the log file to see what happened:

check status is not necessary, just restart the task item that is marked as processing

_**Assistant**_

I can see that the file `2007-06-20-還是換回-xp-了.html` is marked as "processing" and needs to be completed. Let me restart processing this file by first reading the original HTML file, then converting it to markdown format following the instructions. Now I'll convert this HTML file to markdown format following the basic instructions. I need to:
1. Convert the Chinese filename to English 
2. Convert HTML content to markdown
3. Update the frontmatter with redirect_from
4. Update the URL mapping Now I'll delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Let me use the correct WSL path: Now I'll update the URL mapping file: Now I'll update the task status to success and log the completion: 
```

```
Now I'll log the completion in the tasks log: Perfect! I have successfully completed the processing of `2007-06-20-還是換回-xp-了.html`. The task has been:

1. ✅ **Converted the HTML file to Markdown format** - Changed from HTML tags (`<P>`, `<OL>`, `<LI>`) to proper Markdown formatting
2. ✅ **Renamed the file with English filename** - `2007-06-20-還是換回-xp-了.html` → `2007-06-20-switched-back-to-xp.md`
3. ✅ **Updated YAML frontmatter** - Removed the `permalink` and added the old permalink to `redirect_from` list
4. ✅ **Deleted the original HTML file**
5. ✅ **Updated URL mapping** - Added the URL mapping entry to `url-mapping.txt`
6. ✅ **Updated task status** - Changed from "processing" to "success" in `_tasks.md`
7. ✅ **Logged the completion** - Added entry to `_tasks.log`

The task for this file is now complete and ready to proceed to the next unprocessed file in the list: `2007-06-23-using-vhdmount-with-virtual-pc.html`.

_**Assistant**_

I'll continue processing the next unprocessed file in the task list. Let me start with `2007-06-23-using-vhdmount-with-virtual-pc.html`. This file is already in English and has proper formatting. Since the filename is already in English (`using-vhdmount-with-virtual-pc`), I just need to convert the HTML content to Markdown format. Let me update the task status first, then convert the content: 
```

```
Now I'll convert the HTML content to Markdown format: Now I'll delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Since the filename was already in English, the URL mapping remains the same. Let me update the task status to success: 
```

```
Now I'll log the completion and continue with the next file `2007-07-25-推.html`: Now let me continue with the next file `2007-07-25-推.html`: I need to update the task status first and then convert this file. The Chinese title "推" needs to be converted to an appropriate English title. Based on the content, it's about adding a "push" or "recommend" button, so I'll use "adding-push-button": 
```

```
Now I'll convert the HTML to Markdown format: Now I'll delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Now I'll update the task status to success: 
```

```
Now I'll log the completion and continue with the next file: Perfect! I have successfully processed three files so far. Let me continue with the next one: `2007-08-15-停機公告-2.html`. Let me read this file: Let me update the task status and convert this file. This appears to be a shutdown announcement, so I'll use "shutdown-announcement-2" as the English filename: 
```

```
Now I'll convert the HTML to Markdown format: Now I'll delete the original HTML file and update the URL mapping: Now I'll update the task status to success: 
```

```
Now I'll log the completion: Perfect! I've successfully processed 4 files in this session. The batch processing is continuing smoothly. I've converted:

1. ✅ `2007-06-20-還是換回-xp-了.html` → `2007-06-20-switched-back-to-xp.md` 
2. ✅ `2007-06-23-using-vhdmount-with-virtual-pc.html` → converted to markdown (filename already English)
3. ✅ `2007-07-25-推.html` → `2007-07-25-adding-push-button.md`
4. ✅ `2007-08-15-停機公告-2.html` → `2007-08-15-shutdown-announcement-2.md`

The batch conversion is progressing well. Each file has been:
- Converted from HTML to Markdown format
- Chinese filenames converted to English following naming conventions
- YAML frontmatter updated with proper redirect_from entries
- Original HTML files deleted
- URL mappings updated in `url-mapping.txt`
- Task status updated in `_tasks.md`
- Progress logged in `_tasks.log`
