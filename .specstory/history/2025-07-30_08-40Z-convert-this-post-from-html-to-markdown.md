_**Assistant**_

I'll convert this HTML blog post to Markdown following the instructions provided. Let me start by analyzing the file and then performing the conversion. Now I'll create the Markdown version following the conversion instructions: Now let me check which image files are referenced to validate if they exist locally: Let me check all the images referenced in the converted file: Now let me verify that all the image files exist: Great! All the referenced image files exist locally. Now let me remove the original HTML file and commit the changes: Perfect! I have successfully converted the HTML blog post to Markdown following the provided instructions. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Conversion Summary

**Step 1: Variables Defined**
- `post_id` = `2016-02-07-buy_minipc_server`
- `year` = `2016`
- `publish_date` = `2016-02-07`

**Step 2: Content Conversion**
✅ **YAML frontmatter preserved** - Kept the header unchanged between `---` markers
✅ **HTML to Markdown conversion**:
   - Removed all HTML tags (`<p>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.)
   - Converted `<h2>` headings to `##` Markdown headings
   - Converted HTML links `<a href="...">text</a>` to `text`
   - Converted HTML lists `<ul>` and `<li>` to Markdown lists
   - Converted HTML images and captions to Markdown format with alt text

**Step 3: Images and Links Handled**
✅ **Local images converted** - Changed all image paths from `columns.chicken-house.net` URLs to local paths (`/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/...`)
✅ **No external images to download** - All images were already hosted locally

**Step 4: Output Created**
✅ Created `2016-02-07-buy_minipc_server.md`

**Step 5: Validation Checklist**
✅ All referenced image files exist locally:
