convert this post from html to markdown

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you convert the HTML post to Markdown format. First, let me read the current file to see its content. Let me read the rest of the file to get the complete content: Now I'll convert this HTML post to Markdown format. I'll create a new file with the .md extension and convert all the HTML tags to proper Markdown syntax. Perfect! I've successfully converted your HTML post to Markdown format. Here's what I did:

## Key conversions made:

1. **HTML tags to Markdown:**
   - `<h1>` tags → `##` (h2 level headings)
   - `<strong>` tags → `**bold text**`
   - `<a href="">` tags → `text` format
   - `<img>` tags → `!alt text` format
   - `<ol>` and `<li>` tags → numbered lists with proper indentation
   - `<p>` tags → removed (Markdown handles paragraphs with line breaks)

2. **Image handling:**
   - Converted `[caption]` shortcodes to standard Markdown image syntax
   - Preserved all image URLs
   - Added alt text where appropriate

3. **Code blocks:**
   - Converted inline code commands to proper code fences with backticks
   - Maintained the command structure for Docker commands

4. **Links:**
   - Converted all HTML links to Markdown link format
   - Preserved all URLs and link text

5. **Structure:**
   - Kept the original front matter (YAML header) intact
   - Converted HTML headings to proper Markdown heading levels
   - Maintained the numbered list structure for the step-by-step instructions

The new file is saved as `2015-10-31-coreclr-helloworld-consoleapp.md` and should now be properly formatted for Jekyll/Markdown processing while preserving all the original content and structure.

I see you want me to continue with the conversion process. Looking at the instructions file, I need to follow Step 1 to define variables and apply the conversion rules. Let me analyze the current file and apply the required variables and formatting. Based on the instructions, I need to define the variables according to Step 1. Let me extract the variables from the file path and name:

- **Input**: `2015-10-31-coreclr-helloworld-consoleapp.md`
- **post_id** = `2015-10-31-coreclr-helloworld-consoleapp`
- **year** = `2015`
- **publish_date** = `2015-10-31`

Now I should apply these variables to the front matter. Looking at the current file, I need to add the missing front matter fields like `date` and potentially update the structure according to the instructions.

I'll continue with the remaining steps from the instructions. Let me first check if there's an original HTML file that needs to be handled, then proceed with the validation checklist and commit. Now let me analyze the current Markdown file to validate the images according to Step 5: Now I need to convert the image URLs from `columns.chicken-house.net` to local paths according to Step 3. Let me update the images first:
